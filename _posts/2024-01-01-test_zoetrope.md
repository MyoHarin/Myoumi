# Sappy Zoetropes: A Journey Through Time and Imagination

Welcome to the whimsical world of **Sappy Zoetropes**! In this blog, we’ll explore the fascinating concept of zoetropes, their historical significance, and how they inspire creativity today. 

## What is a Zoetrope?

A zoetrope is an early animation device that creates the illusion of motion by displaying a sequence of images. Invented in the 19th century, it consists of a cylindrical drum with slits, inside which a strip of images is placed. When the drum spins, viewers look through the slits and see a series of images that appear to animate.

### A Brief History

The zoetrope was invented in 1834 by William George Horner, although it became popular later in the 1860s. It was one of the first devices to allow people to see moving images, paving the way for modern animation and film.
